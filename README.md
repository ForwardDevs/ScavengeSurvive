## Overview

Scavenge and Survive is a PvP SA:MP survival gamemode. The aim of the game is to find supplies such as tools or weapons to help you survive, either alone or in a group.

The overall objective is to build a stable community and defend it from players with more hostile intentions.

Items spawn around the map in various places categorised by type, rarity and location. Vehicles are rare and spawn with damaged engines or tires and will usually spawn with loot inside the trunk.

No gameplay mechanics require the use of commands. All gameplay has been built with an intuitive _interaction model_ in mind with only 5 major keys required to access the gamemode-specific features.


## Development

Development of this project requires [`sampctl`](https://github.com/Southclaws/sampctl), a package management and project build tool for SA:MP. It's easy to install and easy to use. To compile the gamemode, run:

```bash
sampctl project build
```

I encourage people to play around with this code, create a new map and put loot spawns in it or completely mod it into a new gamemode, I would love to see what creations are made! Please publish all bug fixes in order to benefit everyone.

That being said, This is not a simple project, you have been warned. I do not have time to provide tech-support so please do not contact me asking me for help compiling the project (sorry!)

### Don't Be Selfish

When you fix something, don't keep it to yourself. This is an open source project. An important part of open source is sharing, that's why this code is free of charge and available to all.

Please respect this. Feel free to keep your unique features private, just submit *all* fixes to the base code as pull requests or just email them to me/post them as issues here.

### Builds

Each time I compile a version of the gamemode, the build number (stored in `BUILD_NUMBER`) is incremented. This is also shown in-game at the top-right of the screen and will allow players and developers to know which version is in use which can help track issues and fix bugs.
